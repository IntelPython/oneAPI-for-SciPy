## What is oneAPI?

[oneAPI](https://www.oneapi.io/) is an open standard for a unified application
programming interface (API) that delivers a common developer experience across
accelerator architectures, including multi-core CPUs, GPUs, FPGAs.

A freely available implementation of the standard is available through
[Intel(R) oneAPI Toolkits][toolkits]. The [Intel(R) Base Toolkit][basekit] features
an industry-leading C++ compiler that implements [SYCL*][sycl], an evolution of C++
for heterogeneous computing. It also includes a suite of performance libraries, such as
Intel(R) oneAPI Math Kernel Library ([oneMKL][oneMKL]), etc, as well as
[Intel(R) Distribution for Python*][idp].
