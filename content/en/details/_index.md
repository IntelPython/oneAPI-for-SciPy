## oneAPI for Scientific Python community
by _Diptorup Deb_ and _Oleksandr Pavlyk_, Intel Corporation

---

With this poster we would like to inform Scientific Python community about
oneAPI programming model for heterogeneous systems and how to leverage it for
the benefit of Python users.

We hope to interest Python extension authors to start developing portable
accelerator-aware Python packages using oneAPI. This poster presents the tooling
to build Python extensions with DPC++, as well as Python binding to DPC++
runtime classes implemented in `dpctl`.
